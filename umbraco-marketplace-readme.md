## Umbraco UI Builder

UI Builder is the back office UI builder for Umbraco brought to you by Umbraco HQ

UI Builder abstracts away the complexities of creating custom back office integrations behind a developer friendly and strongly typed fluent API. Using this API developers are able to define a configuration against their own data models which UI Builder then uses to automatically create the relevant UI needed to manage that content. From sections, to trees, list views to editor interfaces, UI Builder takes care of it all.

Built on top of Umbraco, UI Builder makes use of much of the same UI elements as used by Umbraco itself meaning the generated UI is seamless and familiar to editors. Not just a skin though, UI Builder also uses a lot of developer patterns such as property editors allowing developers to reuse their favourite extensions for managing there own data.

With UI Builder, what would previously have taken multiple developers several days to develop, now takes just one a matter of minutes.
